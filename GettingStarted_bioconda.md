# Getting started with Bioconda and Bioconda
In our lab, We prefer to use miniconda to manage environment for such a software with a specific version of its dependencies by isolate them into a specific environments. Moreover, we usually perform computational analyses on shared server of our department, so managing environment with miniconda make user to perform any software without root permission and user can manage environment, such as add recipes, create environment, or even delete environment by themselves.
